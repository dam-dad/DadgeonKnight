Greetings, young adventurer. I see the determination in your eyes.
You are on a noble quest to retrieve the Sword of Courage, I presume?
I see the potential in you to become a great hero. That is why, I would like to give you this sword.
This sword has been passed down from generations of knights. It is a symbol of hope and courage. May it guide you on your journey and protect you from harm.
